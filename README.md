# prediction-of-diabetes
Diabetes prediction using Machine Learning analyzes health data like glucose, BMI, and age to identify risk. Models like Logistic Regression or Random Forest are trained on datasets to detect patterns. After training, the model predicts diabetes likelihood, enabling early diagnosis and better treatment through accurate, data-driven insights.
